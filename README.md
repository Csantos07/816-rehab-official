- Cleaned the Architecture

  - Group by resource

- Understand the Favicon

- In the home section I need to turn off the hover..
  - Should be a media query solution:

https://ben.page/media-hover#:~:text=You%20can%20easily%20fix%20this,a%20cursor%20that%20can%20hover.&text=Now%2C%20the%20styles%20inside%20that,if%20the%20device%20supports%20hover.

Next Steps:

- Turn off the call to action hover for mobile

- Make the site more responisve
- Bring in the navigation

Extract css to mirror components.
